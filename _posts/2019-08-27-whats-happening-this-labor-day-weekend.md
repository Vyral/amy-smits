This is going to be a fantastic weekend here in the Rocky Mountains. Here are all of the local events you need to know about.

It’s looking like it’s going to be a beautiful Labor Day Weekend here in Frisco and Vail. To get you ready for the weekend, we just wanted to share a few different events happening soon.

Starting on Friday night, you can head on over to the John Popper and Brothers Keeper concert at the Dillon Amphitheatre. **It’s a free show\!** The next night, you can come back for another free concert with Larkin Poe.<br>&nbsp;<br>In Keystone, we have both Taste of Keystone and Oktoberfest coming up later in the month. Duwop Denny is always a lot of fun and is also playing on Saturday night at the Silverthorne Pavilion. **Or you can head over to Breckenridge for the Great Divide Art Festival, one of the top art festivals in the U.S.**

Copper Mountain’s Copper Country music festival is also on Saturday and Sunday. If you’re into jazz, Vail has a five-day jazz festival starting on August 30 and going until September 3. The Vail duck race is also that weekend and the largest rotary club fundraiser of the season.
