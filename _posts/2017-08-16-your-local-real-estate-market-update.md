What’s happening in the East Vail and Summit County real estate market?

Properties coming on the market right now have come down a bit in price. Yesterday, there were 31 price reductions. Buyers are ready to buy, but properties need to be priced correctly in order to sell.

That said, homes priced under $500,000 tend to sell in less than a week. Homes between $500,000 and $1 million are selling in under two months. However, homes over $1 million are selling slower, since that is where we have the majority of our inventory. There are also fewer buyers in that price range.

If you are thinking of buying or selling a home, reach out to us and make sure that we have your housing criteria set up correctly. Homes are selling quickly, and it’s important that we match your motivation to our motivation. If you want to buy quickly, for example, we want to be able to get in touch with you as soon as possible. If you don’t want to buy for another year or so, we want to check in with you every couple months to touch base.

We also have a couple of exciting new properties that will be on the market. There are two brand-new duplexes that will come on the East Vail market in the next couple of weeks at $2 million. If you are interested, let someone on our team know and we will send you as much information as we can, including 3-D tours.

We also have a couple of condos in the $350,000 price range. Those will sell quickly, so get in touch with us soon if you are interested.

As always, if you have any other real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
