Recently someone asked us, “Who is the best short-term property manager?”

Well, the truth is that we could not name just one. There are a few different companies we work with that have different rental numbers in different areas. So if you are thinking of hiring someone to manage your short-term rental property, please reach out so we can have a discussion about who would be the best fit for your needs.

With that said, many people choose to manage their short-term rental property on their own using Airbnb or VRBO (vacation rental by owner). There are also companies that will help you with bookings and cleaning, while leaving the rest up to you. If you are going this route, we would love to help you out by having our photographer create a 3D virtual tour of your property.

The reality is that there are a variety of different property management companies out there that offer a variety of services. It all comes down to your personal preference.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like a list of some great local property management companies, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
