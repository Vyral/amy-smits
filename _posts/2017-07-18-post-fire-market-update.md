Thank goodness that the winds have shifted and we are finally getting some rain in Summit County. The fire last week was frightening. Anytime you see flames in the mountains, it’s pretty scary.

Although parts of Breckenridge were evacuated, everyone is back home safe now and the fire is out. We were lucky that the winds shifted and the rains came. Thanks to everyone who had a hand in helping control and put out that nasty fire.

As far as the real estate market is concerned, our inventory is finally starting to pick up. The average days on market remains extremely low. If you’re looking to buy a home up here, give us a call, text, or email now so we can start aggressively searching for a home for you. Even if you’re out of town, we can FaceTime or Skype you in to take a look at any homes. There are quite a few that have recently come on the market.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
