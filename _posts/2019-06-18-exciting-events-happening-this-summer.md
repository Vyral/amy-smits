<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Summer is officially here, and we’re ready to celebrate in style.</em></p>

Today I’m on-site at the Frisco Bay Marina to share a couple of quick announcements with you. First, preparations are well underway here to help kick off summer. Right now, they’re dredging around the marina, and they’ve removed all the dirt along the recreation path, which is a great place to bike and hike. Our office is just a couple of blocks away, so you know we’ll be there when the party starts.

Also, remember that we’re throwing a party at our office for the Fourth of July, so you’re welcome to join us as we watch the parade on Main Street. Last year, we had over 100 attendees, so if you plan on coming, let us know so that we can have plenty of food and drinks for all.&nbsp;

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.&nbsp;
