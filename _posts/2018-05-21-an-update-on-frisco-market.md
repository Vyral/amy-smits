It is a beautiful spring here in Frisco and we’re enjoying some lovely weather in the mountains. If you are thinking about visiting, this is a great time to come up. Today we are going to talk about why you need a real estate agent even in a hot seller’s market like this and even if you are selling your home on your own.

Over the last few weeks, I have been hearing from buyers and sellers who want to know about the For Sale By Owner (FSBO) market. Here are a few recent stories I can share.

First, we just listed a home for someone who wasn’t having much success selling her home FSBO. We had to adjust the price down a little bit, we got professional photos taken, and got the word out to a lot of people either in the area or looking for a home in the area. The property received a full-priced offer in just two weeks. The seller was very excited and is looking forward to closing in the next few weeks.

The next story is of a couple who were trying to sell on their own and they put a very small sign attached to their mailbox. I was showing property in the neighborhood and I gave them a call because I thought one of my buyers might be interested in the home. I told them I wasn’t trying to persuade them to list their home with me, but they proceeded to tell me just how horrible their experience was. They were fielding calls at all hours and they needed help. I ended up listing the home, brought the perfect buyer in, and got the title work, surveys, and disclosures covered.

The main takeaway here is that buyers don’t want to work directly with FSBO sellers. That is why we want to help. If you have seen a FSBO home in the area and you are interested in it, we can provide some insight into the property and maybe even the sellers themselves. We try to find all the FSBO sellers out there and get their information for all of our buyers.

Location is just part of the equation when it comes to selling a home. It is also very important to market the property correctly and provide the most accurate information to buyers in order to make the process as smooth as can be.
