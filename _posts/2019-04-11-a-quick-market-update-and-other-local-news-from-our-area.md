Spring is here, which means exciting things for buyers, sellers, skiers, and foodies in Summit County.

Today I have a few quick announcements for all you Summit County residents out there.&nbsp;

First, **spring is here, and it’s going to be an amazing ski season!** Because of the recent snow, the majority of the ski resorts around Summit County and Vail will have extended closing days. Keystone closed last weekend, but Beaver Creek, Vail, and Copper Mountain are staying open until April 21. Breckenridge, meanwhile, is staying open until Memorial Day, and Arapahoe Basin won’t close its doors until June 2.&nbsp;

If you’re a homebuyer in our area, interest rates have gone down and inventory will start to increase soon, so make sure your agent knows what you’re looking for so they can get the right homes in front of you. If you’re looking to sell, your home needs to be priced right in order to sell quickly. **Our team can help you no matter what your real estate goals are, so give us a call and we’d be happy to help you get started.&nbsp;**

Lastly, the Breckenridge Restaurant Association will be offering the Breckenridge Dining Passport from April 22 to June 6. For just $10, you’ll be able to get all sorts of great discounts at participating restaurants in Summit County, and all of the proceeds will go toward raising money for scholarships for Summit County students.
