<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We’ve got a brand-new VIP program coming this month. Keep reading to find out how you can become a member.</em></p>

It’s winter break in the mountains, so we snuck off to our home in Puerto Rico to start rebuilding it after Hurricane Maria last year. In the meantime, there are a few things I wanted to talk to you about.

First off, I just wanted to let you know how appreciative we are of you, our friends and clients. **We are starting a new VIP program this month just for you.** Each month, we’ll give away 10 to 15 different gift cards to some great places in the Frisco area. All you need to do is <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1vHyaCdCSRiuPa3fPPWFavg2gpo6" target="_blank">register here</a> so we make sure we have the correct information. When you win, we’ll send the gift card off to you or you can come pick it up.

**This month, we wanted to also remind you of the great Nordic ski areas in Frisco.** We have the Adventure Park, [two different](https://www.breckenridgerecreation.com/locations/gold-run-nordic-center){: target="_blank"} Nordic Centers in Breckenridge, [one](https://www.keystoneresort.com/){: target="_blank"} in Keystone that is also near the golf course, and there’s also [one](https://www.coppercolorado.com/){: target="_blank"} in Copper that a lot of people are unaware of. Next time you’re in town, if you want to try something different and new, check out [one](http://www.vailrec.com/vail-recreation/nordic){: target="_blank"} of [these](https://www.beavercreek.com/plan-your-trip/ski-and-ride-lessons/category/nordic-center.aspx){: target="_blank"} Nordic centers.

**Finally, a quick update on the market.** It’s doing great right now and, although inventory continues to remain low, it’s still a great time to buy or sell. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
