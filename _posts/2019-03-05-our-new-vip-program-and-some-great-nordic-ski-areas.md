<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We’ve got a brand-new VIP program coming this month. Keep reading to find out how you can become a member.</em></p>

It’s winter break in the mountains, so we snuck off to our home in Puerto Rico to start rebuilding it after Hurricane Maria last year. In the meantime, there are a few things I wanted to talk to you about.

First off, I just wanted to let you know how appreciative we are of you, our friends and clients. **We are starting a new VIP program this month just for you.** Each month, we’ll give away 10 to 15 different gift cards to some great places in the Frisco area. All you need to do is register here so we make sure we have the correct information. When you win, we’ll send the gift card off to you or you can come pick it up.

**This month, we wanted to also remind you of the great Nordic ski areas in Frisco.** We have the Adventure Park, [two different](https://www.breckenridgerecreation.com/locations/gold-run-nordic-center){: target="_blank"} Nordic Centers in Breckenridge, [one](https://www.keystoneresort.com/){: target="_blank"} in Keystone that is also near the golf course, and there’s also [one](https://www.coppercolorado.com/){: target="_blank"} in Copper that a lot of people are unaware of. Next time you’re in town, if you want to try something different and new, check out [one](http://www.vailrec.com/vail-recreation/nordic){: target="_blank"} of [these](https://www.beavercreek.com/plan-your-trip/ski-and-ride-lessons/category/nordic-center.aspx){: target="_blank"} Nordic centers.

**Finally, a quick update on the market.** It’s doing great right now and, although inventory continues to remain low, it’s still a great time to buy or sell. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
