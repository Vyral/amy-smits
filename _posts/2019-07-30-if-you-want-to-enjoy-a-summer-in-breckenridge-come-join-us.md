Today I wanted to share a quick message about my trip to see Isak Heartstone, the troll built out of wood and trash here in Breckenridge, and about the state of our market.

If the number of visitors here to see Isak Heartstone is any indication, summer is in full swing. The weather has also been amazing lately, and on that note, the market is picking up steam.

We have plenty of great inventory available to show you, so if you want to enjoy the summer in Breckenridge, get in touch with us soon.
